# Music-Player-For-Events
I made a music player to be used for events. Not very good, but its functional :)

To use it, just put your favourite songs into the `songs` folder. Then, run the python file and click on `Load Songs`. From there, you can shuffle the playlist, play/stop the songs, and more!
